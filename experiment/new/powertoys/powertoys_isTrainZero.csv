can you please help us fix this issue by clarifying the following - do you have the wox app installed on your system? if yes then what version is it and was wox running when you were trying to run powertoys run? if you do have wox installed then can you please specify which plugins you have running thank you! @ryanbodrug-microsoft @somil55 note: `pushresults` was previously used in the wox code base (commit ac81d38acc76438028dc3f06704f21c147adc565 and c596039453523fdfa7d4daceaa91bce8f9df783d were the changes made to use it in one of the plugins and the second commit is where it was removed) the `pushresults` function is still present in the publicapiinstance class of the wox codebase ( but it is not used by any of the default plugins it is considered an obsolete function and would no longer be supported from version 14 of wox however i dont understand why this would be affecting pt run because we dont have any plugin calling it and neither is our model extensible to install other plugins at the moment || hi @alekhyareddy28 i do not currently have or have ever previously had wox installed i did have issues with installing 0200 as noted in #5545 in case there is any relation || thank you @andrewcarvalho to help debug further can you please share the log file located at c:\users\username\appdata\local\microsoft\powertoys\powertoys run\logs\100? || also we have an error reporting window which should pop-up with the error message did that pop-up along with the error message? thank you || no reporting window popped up i can see in the details view of the task manager that powerlauncherexe appears briefly then silently exits when launchedthis is the most recent log from the folder: [2020-08-05txt]( || @andrewcarvalho can you please go to this folder (c:\program files\powertoys\modules\launcher) and share the versions for the following dlls - powerlauncherdll powerlauncherexe woxcoredll woxplugindll woxinfrastructuredll?you can do so by just hovering over the item it should be present in the tooltip data (as file version:)-  ( can you clarify if there is a woxdll present in that folder?thanks a lot for helping us debug this issue we really appreciate it ive been trying to reproduce it but havnt been able to yet || @andrewcarvalho after sharing the above information can you please try if the following msi fixes the issue?[test_buildzip]( you once again for taking the time to help us debug note: this is a locally built unsigned build to be used only for testing please uninstall it before installing the next official build of powertoys  || powerlauncherdll -> 02010powerlauncherexe -> 02010woxcoredll -> 1000woxplugin -> 1000woxinfrastructure -> 1000woxdll -> 1000ive installed the unsigned msi and can confirm that the issue is resolved: powerlauncherexe is running and my assigned shortcut key is functioning as expected the wox dlls form this version of the installer (99010) are present and i have nothing showing up in event viewerthanks so much and ill make sure to uninstall before upgrading to 021x || @andrewcarvalho thank you for your help with fixing this issue just to wrap it up can you confirm that you no longer see a woxdll in this folder (c:\program files\powertoys\modules\launcher)?  || i actually *do* still have the woxdll present in that folder though it seems to be functioning correctly with it present || @ryanbodrug-microsoft ive removed reference to the wox dll in all of our code in the above pr so the above exception would not be thrown however the older woxdll still persists@enricogior the previous dll doesnt seem to be getting removed we removed an assembly (woxdll) but on upgrade it doesnt seem to be getting removed from the users installation directory to add to that the version of woxdll was previously set to 100 and it did not follow the versioning of powertoys do you think this might be the reason for that?  i have tried to reproduce it but the woxdll gets deleted for me on upgrade || @alekhyareddy28 how was the upgrade done? using the exe (auto update) or manually using the msi?the exe does a full uninstall before installing so it should not be possible that the old dll was still thereon the other hand the msi does an upgrade and in theory its possible that the old dll is still in use || i used the msi its very likely that some issues i was dealing with previously (0200 would not install) and some of the noodling i had done to try and deal with it may have caused some artifacts to be left over so it wasnt exactly a clean test to be fair that could have been the cause of the issue to begin withif you have any additional tests youd like me to run (like uninstalling rolling back and trying the upgrade or this unsigned build again) i can give that a shot || @andrewcarvalho i would say that it was just a glitch because of the 0200 installer problems || this should be resolved in our 0211 release of powertoys   to download it ||,1.0,0.0,removed internals

though@ryanbodrug-microsoft i agree that centralizing settings would tackle these issue and it can be handled separately thanks for your clarification || @ryanbodrug-microsoft ive made the changes as suggestednow we have a wrapper singleton class namely `generalsettingscache` which has a property `commonsettingsconfig` these configurations are shared across all the viewmodels ive not touched settingsutilscs and the file handing/ipc i was thinking if we need to make any changes to unify that we can do so after we get your refactoring/testing pr invalidated the following:* runner and all powertoys respond correctly to changes in settings* settings reads only once (on start-up) from the settingsjson file throughout its lifetime it continues to get information from the `generalsettingscache`* validated that the modelconverter also works as expected and that there is only one instance of the `commonsettingsconfig` shared across all the viewmodels* all tests pass- ( || @ryanbodrug-microsoft ive made the suggested changes there is now a generic singleton class `settingsrepository` which encapsulates the disk accessesso any viewmodel can get the settings information using `settingsrepository<generalsettings>instancesettingsconfig` `settingsrepository<shortcutguidesettings>instancesettingsconfig`right now fz shortcut guide and power preview use this interface along with generalsettings ive validated the a change in the settings ui in each of these reflects in the actual powertoy (other than preview handlers which seem to be on all the time)as suggested ive added a lock during initialization of `settingsrepository` and also added tests for the same to ensure that multiple instances are not created when accessed by multiple threadsi shall look into migrating the other pt settings to this repository once i get a better understanding of the way in which each of them accesses the disk/passes the information to runneri hvnt moved the ipc delegates to settingsutils from the view models yet shall do that separately as this pr is getting quite big thanks for patiently reviewing this pr 😄  || also to add the getfile function should ideally not be needed in the long run previously getsettings was just reading from a file and did not have a check to see if the file existed or notsince getsettings has been modified to create the file if it does not exist getfile does what getsettings previously used to this is because in two cases the defaultjson file of kbm and settingsjson of pt run these two files are assumed to be created by runner (if they dont exist) and not settings hence the `getfile()` function was added || pulled the changes for master which modified the settings testsmade the following changes :* shortcutguide fz powerpreview dont need settingsutils to be passed as it is encapsulated within the settings repositorys settigns config object hence that has been removed* the tests have been refactored so that they work when settings utils is passed to the setting repository generic interface previously the stub of getsettings was a generic with no type constraints hence it could be easily mocked as `<itisanytype>` however since the getsettings function must now implement the `isettingsconfig` interface the stub has been modified accordingly there is no functionality in moq to specify a generic with a type constraint other than using a custom matcher even if we go down this route the class definitions have to be modified to implement `itypematcher` and they must still be invoked individually by specifying the class as `getsettings<generalsettings>`* validated that all refactored tests pass![image]( validated that settings and all powertoys work as expected with and without previous

serialization/deserialization of the the data individually  i think that issue could be treated separately though || > @somil55 imho potential failure on write is another reason to centralize access to the settings each view model shouldnt need to synchronize and ensure resiliency wrt to serialization/deserialization of the the data individually i think that issue could be treated separately though@ryanbodrug-microsoft i agree that centralizing settings would tackle these issue and it can be handled separately thanks for your clarification || @ryanbodrug-microsoft ive made the changes as suggestednow we have a wrapper singleton class namely `generalsettingscache` which has a property `commonsettingsconfig` these configurations are shared across all the viewmodels ive not touched settingsutilscs and the file handing/ipc i was thinking if we need to make any changes to unify that we can do so after we get your refactoring/testing pr invalidated the following:* runner and all powertoys respond correctly to changes in settings* settings reads only once (on start-up) from the settingsjson file throughout its lifetime it continues to get information from the `generalsettingscache`* validated that the modelconverter also works as expected and that there is only one instance of the `commonsettingsconfig` shared across all the viewmodels* all tests pass- ( || @ryanbodrug-microsoft ive made the suggested changes there is now a generic singleton class `settingsrepository` which encapsulates the disk accessesso any viewmodel can get the settings information using `settingsrepository<generalsettings>instancesettingsconfig` `settingsrepository<shortcutguidesettings>instancesettingsconfig`right now fz shortcut guide and power preview use this interface along with generalsettings ive validated the a change in the settings ui in each of these reflects in the actual powertoy (other than preview handlers which seem to be on all the time)as suggested ive added a lock during initialization of `settingsrepository` and also added tests for the same to ensure that multiple instances are not created when accessed by multiple threadsi shall look into migrating the other pt settings to this repository once i get a better understanding of the way in which each of them accesses the disk/passes the information to runneri hvnt moved the ipc delegates to settingsutils from the view models yet shall do that separately as this pr is getting quite big thanks for patiently reviewing this pr 😄  || also to add the getfile function should ideally not be needed in the long run previously getsettings was just reading from a file and did not have a check to see if the file existed or notsince getsettings has been modified to create the file if it does not exist getfile does what getsettings previously used to this is because in two cases the defaultjson file of kbm and settingsjson of pt run these two files are assumed to be created by runner (if they dont exist) and not settings hence the `getfile()` function was added || pulled the changes for master which modified the settings testsmade the following changes :* shortcutguide fz powerpreview dont need settingsutils to be passed as it is encapsulated within the settings repositorys settigns config object hence that has been removed* the tests have been refactored so that they work when settings utils is passed to the setting repository generic interface previously the stub of getsettings was a generic with no type constraints hence it could be easily mocked as `<itisanytype>` however since the getsettings function must now implement the `isettingsconfig` interface the stub has been modified accordingly there is no functionality in moq to specify a generic with a type constraint other than using a custom matcher even if we go down this route the class definitions have to be modified to implement `itypematcher` and they must still be invoked individually by specifying the class as `getsettings<generalsettings>`* validated that all refactored tests pass![image]( validated that settings and all powertoys work as expected with and without previous

crashing because the redraws adding a delay would be fine by me if you’ve ever used a tiling wm on linux like i3 you’ll notice how slow and cumbersome it is to switch layouts in fancyzones that is my main issue my suggested implementation was just that a suggestion any change that improves switching layouts is welcome  || well cycling would imply something like this:you have layouts abcdef and you have a hotkey that you press assume you start at athen press b press c press d press e press f press a (and so on)so you cycle thru the list and then right back to the beginningif you did that very fast and the windows would reposition immediately youd get flashing lightsand it would be quite disorienting but if you have delays it wouldnt be all that fastthats why i find a cycling-apporach very inelegantbeing able to assign individual hotkeys for each layout would be much betteror making the win+`-menu more performant and accessible(which has the benefit of being much simpler to implement id

shortcut to cycle through selected layouts,# keyboard shortcut to cycle through selected layoutsi often switch between two layouts would be nice to have a keyboard shortcut that allows users to switch between selected layouts# proposed technical implementation details (optional)add a user definable shortcut that allows cycling through selected layouts without using the editoreg:- checkbox on `custom layout 1` and `custom layout 2` etc to add them to the pool of layouts to be included in the cycle- add user definable keyboard shortcut that cycles through the layouts enabled by checkboxwould also be nice to have different layouts enabled for different monitors and to cycle follow mouse pointer or focus,agreed the existing  ctrl+win+[number]  shortcut should allow arbitrary layouts to be assigned to each slot instead of automatically assigning layouts to each number based on `zonecount` i understand this requires additional ui but there are definitely multiple 3-zone 4-zone and 5-zone layouts that i would like to regularly switch between depending on the app || re: cyclingcycling would be either very slow or if it was decently fast cause eppilepsy with the

need to be a delay added for the rearrange for using such a cycle hotkeyenglish is not my native language so i might have used the wrong term regarding cycling in my use case i switch between layouts maybe every 5-10 minutes don’t see how that could case epilepsy or crashing because the redraws adding a delay would be fine by me if you’ve ever used a tiling wm on linux like i3 you’ll notice how slow and cumbersome it is to switch layouts in fancyzones that is my main issue my suggested implementation was just that a suggestion any change that improves switching layouts is welcome  || well cycling would imply something like this:you have layouts abcdef and you have a hotkey that you press assume you start at athen press b press c press d press e press f press a (and so on)so you cycle thru the list and then right back to the beginningif you did that very fast and the windows would reposition immediately youd get flashing lightsand it would be quite disorienting but if you have delays it wouldnt be all that fastthats why i find a cycling-apporach very inelegantbeing able to assign individual hotkeys for each layout would be much betteror making the win+`-menu more performant

cycle through selected layouts,# keyboard shortcut to cycle through selected layoutsi often switch between two layouts would be nice to have a keyboard shortcut that allows users to switch between selected layouts# proposed technical implementation details (optional)add a user definable shortcut that allows cycling through selected layouts without using the editoreg:- checkbox on `custom layout 1` and `custom layout 2` etc to add them to the pool of layouts to be included in the cycle- add user definable keyboard shortcut that cycles through the layouts enabled by checkboxwould also be nice to have different layouts enabled for different monitors and to cycle follow mouse pointer or focus,agreed the existing  ctrl+win+[number]  shortcut should allow arbitrary layouts to be assigned to each slot instead of automatically assigning layouts to each number based on `zonecount` i understand this requires additional ui but there are definitely multiple 3-zone 4-zone and 5-zone layouts that i would like to regularly switch between depending on the app || re: cyclingcycling would be either very slow or if it was decently fast cause eppilepsy with the automatic window-rezone-feature on [not to mention all the zone flashing]and from what ive seen from some programs theyd just crash or freeze if having to redraw too often too quicklyperhaps there would need to be a delay added for the rearrange for using such a cycle hotkeybut i think just adding the possibility of making the win+`-menu keyboard-navigable would be a more elegant solution to the same problem (switching layouts is too cumbersome and slow)[as i mentioned there] || > re: cycling> cycling would be either very slow or if it was decently fast cause eppilepsy with the automatic window-rezone-feature on [not to

rearrange for using such a cycle hotkeyenglish is not my native language so i might have used the wrong term regarding cycling in my use case i switch between layouts maybe every 5-10 minutes don’t see how that could case epilepsy or crashing because the redraws adding a delay would be fine by me if you’ve ever used a tiling wm on linux like i3 you’ll notice how slow and cumbersome it is to switch layouts in fancyzones that is my main issue my suggested implementation was just that a suggestion any change that improves switching layouts is welcome  || well cycling would imply something like this:you have layouts abcdef and you have a hotkey that you press assume you start at athen press b press c press d press e press f press a (and so on)so you cycle thru the list and then right back to the beginningif you did that very fast and the windows would reposition immediately youd get flashing lightsand it would be quite disorienting but if you have delays it wouldnt be all that fastthats why i find a cycling-apporach very inelegantbeing able to assign individual hotkeys for each layout would be much betteror making the win+`-menu more performant and accessible(which has the benefit of being much simpler to implement id imagine)i agree with your approach doesnt matter how it can be done fast as long as its fast at the moment it aintthough ill be making a couple ahk-script today to call up the layout-switcher and make the mouse move to auto-click those ridicolous mouse-only-squares :)ive looked over the shoulder of someone who was much comfortable with i3 and was very impressed i personally ran away screaming because when i installed it all of a sudden i had no idea how to turn my wifi back on in ubuntu without googling i3-documentation on my smartphone || i would love to see a functionality likely his as well though for me it would be a simpler temporary replacement for a tiling managermy idea is to have hotkeys for increasing and decreasing the zone count for

temporary replacement for a tiling manager> > my idea is to have hotkeys for increasing and decreasing the zone count for the default layouts> > i would be open to trying to implement it if nobody else is interested enough in iti think that was already implemented once for earlier versions of powertoys to many peoples chagrin it didnt work as intended and also blocked a useful windows default hotkey (control+windows+number)but if you want to give it another shot i think theres existing code to look at not like there needs to be only one mechanic of eventually getting layout changes via hotkey done || > i would love to see a functionality likely his as well though for me it would be a simpler temporary replacement for a tiling manager> > my idea is to have hotkeys for increasing and
